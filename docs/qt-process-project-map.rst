Qt process backend project map
==============================

This file is the implementation/handoff map for qpsycopg's Qt-oriented pq work.
Read :doc:`qt-process` for behaviour, :doc:`qt-process-performance` for measured
history/rejected experiments, :doc:`qt-process-optimization-log` for the current
checkpoint series, and :doc:`qt-process-coordination` for multi-chat ownership.

Repository state
----------------

* repository: ``ARMAGGIDON/qpsycopg``;
* development branch: ``feature/qt-process-pq``;
* active implementation/optimisation path: ``qt-thread``;
* retained process reference: ``PSYCOPG_IMPL=qt-process``;
* thread implementation: ``PSYCOPG_IMPL=qt-thread``;
* canonical local worker for the current paired benchmark: ``QPSYCOPG_WORKER_IMPL=c``;
* upstream comparison revision: ``99356800e90aa0e7b604f652d714ef0f33422b47``;
* canonical optimisation baseline: ``baseline-v3``;
* accepted runtime optimisation: ``optimized01`` lazy qt-thread cancellation setup;
* ``optimized01`` implementation commits: ``4637ff9`` and ``371bda8``;
* ``optimized01`` measured at ``7c781a97`` with the unchanged v3 benchmark,
  semantic smoke OK; retained for improved connection and resource lifecycle;
* next target: measure and isolate qt-thread short-query CPU/latency overhead,
  keeping cancellation/Qt responsiveness as guardrails.

The current branch has moved beyond the old qt-thread connection blocker. The
complete standalone qt-thread smoke passes. Do not restart work from the old
``64f2ee8`` handoff or from the old process short-query micro-optimisation plan.

Current direction
-----------------

The process-backed implementation already contains the major retained measured
optimisations:

* native ``PGresult -> PackedValues`` packing;
* native packed bulk decoding;
* dedicated cancellation control channel;
* ``10 ms`` worker-side WAIT drain;
* deferred send + one-request fast execute;
* compact/marshal fast frames;
* warmed ``QProcess`` reuse between PostgreSQL sessions;
* cached stable connection state where safe;
* Windows TCP loopback fast path;
* raw Windows named-pipe main transport;
* native parent-side named-pipe frame exchange.

Controlled architecture measurements showed that a dedicated worker thread is
substantially closer to upstream/direct Psycopg than the separate process for
short queries while preserving the required Qt/cancellation semantics. The real
``qt-thread`` backend is therefore the active optimisation path. ``qt-process``
remains a measured reference and an explicit alternative with stronger isolation.

The canonical ``baseline-v3`` established representative qt-thread/upstream
ratios of approximately:

==============================  ===========
Metric                          qt-thread
==============================  ===========
warm connect median             1.409x
SELECT 1 median                 1.273x
short-query CPU                 2.000x
context switches / query        3.032x
100k total                      1.027x
8-thread batch median           1.341x
process-tree RSS                1.320x
private memory                  1.377x
Qt timer p95                    0.982x
Qt timer p99                    1.008x
==============================  ===========

Bulk decode and Qt p95/p99 are not current targets. The remaining stable cost is
primarily short-query fixed overhead plus connection/resource overhead.

Architectural invariants
------------------------

Treat changes to these points as architectural changes, not local optimisations.

#. High-level Psycopg semantics remain in the application process:
   ``Connection``, ``Cursor``, transactions, adaptation, row factories,
   SQLSTATE exception mapping and user callbacks.
#. The stateful libpq ``PGconn`` is worker-owned for both Qt backends.
#. A recycled process worker does not imply a recycled PostgreSQL session.
#. ``qt-process`` and ``qt-thread`` are explicit opt-in backends and never
   implicit fallbacks.
#. The worker pq implementation is ordinary ``c``, ``binary`` or ``python``;
   never recursive ``qt-process``/``qt-thread``.
#. Result adaptation remains parent-side. Worker/native helpers may pack raw
   bytes/metadata but must not replace normal Psycopg adaptation semantics.
#. Psycopg's existing connection lock remains authoritative when a connection is
   shared by caller threads.
#. Synchronous Psycopg calls remain synchronous and block the caller.
#. Ordinary PostgreSQL statement errors must not kill a healthy session.
#. Fatal ``ConnStatus.BAD`` handling must terminate/mark a broken session.
#. Parent-process file descriptors must not be passed to worker libpq.
#. Resource comparisons must use the whole process tree for process-backed modes.
#. Performance claims require compatible paired measurements.

Current qt-process architecture
-------------------------------

On Windows the preferred data path is::

    application process
      |
      +-- Connection / Cursor / adaptation
      |
      +-- synthetic PGconn / PGresult facade
      |
      +-- deferred send / compact fast execute
      |
      +-- raw named pipe
      |     +-- native parent frame exchange when available
      |
      +================ process boundary ================+
                                                        |
                                               reusable QProcess worker
                                                        |
                                               psycopg c/binary/python pq
                                                        |
                                                      libpq

Cancellation uses an independent authenticated localhost TCP control channel with
a worker cancel-control thread and reusable ``PGcancelConn``.

The main Windows transport defaults to ``QPSYCOPG_IPC=pipe``. TCP remains a
fallback. Native worker receive and native socket wait remain disabled by default
because controlled tests did not justify them.

Current qt-thread architecture
------------------------------

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/pq_qt_thread.py`` reuses the synthetic pq facade and worker
state machine but replaces process IPC with ``queue.SimpleQueue`` and a dedicated
worker thread::

    Connection / Cursor
        |
    synthetic PGconn / PGresult
        |
    request/response queues
        |
    qpsycopg worker thread
        |
    psycopg c/binary/python pq
        |
      libpq

The complete standalone semantic smoke passes. It covers adaptation, packed
NULL/empty semantics, multiple result sets, COPY boundaries, SQL error survival,
shared connection/per-thread cursors, cancellation, fatal backend termination and
``AsyncConnection``.

The native remote packed decoder is enabled for qt-thread; the earlier bulk
regression was caused by an accidental pure-Python transformer and is no longer a
current result.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_thread_lazy.py`` is the current ``optimized01`` patch.
It defers cancel-control construction until immediately before the first normal
send. ``psycopg/psycopg/__init__.py`` activates that patch only for
``PSYCOPG_IMPL=qt-thread``.

Source map
----------

Backend selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/__init__.py``
    Selects ``qt-process`` and ``qt-thread`` only when explicitly requested.

``psycopg/psycopg/__init__.py``
    Routes both Qt backends through the remote connection classes and activates
    the qt-thread lazy-cancellation patch only for qt-thread.

``psycopg/psycopg/_cmodule.py``
    Keeps the Qt backends on the Python generator layer because the synthetic
    ``PGconn`` is not a local native connection object.

Parent/process facade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/pq_qt_process.py``
    Base remote pq facade, generic transport, proxy ``PGconn``/``PGresult`` and
    query/connection caches.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_lazy.py``
    Process hot-path patch layer: deferred send, compact fast execute,
    process-worker reuse, lazy cancellation, Windows transport selection and
    native parent named-pipe frame exchange.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_pipe.py``
    Windows named-pipe byte-stream adapter with read-ahead preservation.

Protocol/results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_protocol.py``
    Request/response framing, fast frames, result snapshots and ``PackedValues``.

``psycopg_c/psycopg_c/pq/pgresult.pyx``
    Native result value/metadata packers.

``psycopg_c/psycopg_c/_psycopg/qt_bulk.pyx``
    Parent-side packed decoder for supported standard loaders.

``psycopg/psycopg/_transformer.py``
    Preserves normal adaptation semantics while selecting the packed decoder for
    both remote Qt backends where safe.

Worker/cancellation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_worker.py``
    Base worker request handling and libpq send/wait/consume/result state machine.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_worker_pool.py``
    Reusable process worker specialisations, cached connection state, native
    packing capability detection and profiling hooks.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_cancel.py``
    Independent authenticated cancellation control channel.

``psycopg/psycopg/connection_qt_process.py``
    Shared sync/async remote connection lifecycle and wait/cancel routing used by
    both Qt backends.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/pq_qt_thread.py``
    Dedicated-thread transport and shared-interpreter worker integration.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_thread_lazy.py``
    Current lazy-cancellation lifecycle optimisation for qt-thread.

Validation and benchmark map
----------------------------

``tools/smoke_qt_thread.py``
    Narrow semantic gate for the thread backend.

``tools/validate_qt_thread.ps1``
    Broader direct/thread/process validation retained for structural checks.

``tools/benchmark_qpsycopg.ps1``
    Canonical current paired benchmark runner. It builds isolated upstream/fork
    environments against the same local libpq and runs adjacent upstream pairs
    for ``direct``, ``qt-thread`` and ``qt-process``.

``tools/bench_qt_process.py``
    SQL/connection/concurrency/cancellation/resource workload.

``tools/bench_qt_responsiveness.py``
    Qt p95/p99 responsiveness workload; maximum stall is diagnostic only.

``tools/summarize_qpsycopg_benchmark.py``
    Produces paired ratios, MAD/range, host drift, architecture deltas and process
    inventory.

``tools/profile_qt_thread_short_query.py`` and
``tools/profile_qt_thread_short_query.ps1``
    Diagnostic CPU attribution: upstream/fork direct/qt-thread warm SELECT
    controls; separate process/caller CPU; worker dispatch/wait phase timers;
    synthetic no-SQL status request as a control for handoff cost. The earlier
    Python 3.13 cProfile attribution was rejected after producing negative
    per-function CPU and cross-thread stack contamination. The corrected
    phase-only Windows archive is now analysed and identifies the synchronous
    thread request/response handoff as the largest fixed non-SQL phase.
    Production runtime and canonical paired v3 workload are unchanged.

``tools/bench_qt_thread_echo_baseline.py`` and
``tools/bench_qt_thread_echo_baseline.ps1``
    Diagnostic-only paired comparison of a minimal two-SimpleQueue echo
    against the existing no-SQL qt-thread PGconn status GET path. Uses timed
    response waits in both cases, interleaved blocks, wall/CPU/context-switch
    measurements, a child-process watchdog and a ZIP result archive.
    The Windows comparison is complete: both modes have about two context
    switches/call; qpsycopg has a positive extra ~19 us median paired
    wall delay but strong temporal drift. Neither the residual nor any
    specific allocation is proven removable. Runtime and benchmark v3
    are unchanged.

``tools/bench_qt_thread_enriched_echo.py`` and
``tools/bench_qt_thread_enriched_echo.ps1``
    Coordinator-approved diagnostic-only progressively enriched queue echo:
    bare token, real Request/Response NamedTuple, validation, synthetic worker
    bookkeeping, and real qt-thread no-SQL GET. Independent subprocess runs,
    short balanced blocks, bracketing bare controls and timestamp-based
    linear drift adjustment. Four independent Windows repetitions are complete:
    representation and synthetic bookkeeping stages show positive effects,
    but one repeat has severe drift and no removable real production
    bottleneck was isolated. Runtime and benchmark v3 remain unchanged.

``tools/profile_qt_thread_get_real_path.py`` and
``tools/profile_qt_thread_get_real_path.ps1``
    Coordinator-approved real qt-thread no-SQL GET status diagnostic.
    One untouched control connection and one instrumented connection per
    independent subprocess; short clean-profiled-clean-profiled-clean
    blocks and timestamp-bracketed drift controls. Temporary method
    wrappers time actual caller request/perform/dispatch/response,
    worker handle/normalize/connection checks and active _run worker
    turn; no cProfile or production code changes. Windows data complete:
    all phase counts valid, but probe overhead was ~18 us per GET and
    no real semantically removable bottleneck was identified.

The canonical current baseline is ``baseline-v3``. Older ``initial`` and
``baseline-v2`` checkpoints used different benchmark definitions and must not be
used as the direct before-state for numbered optimisations.

Established decisions / do not repeat blindly
---------------------------------------------

* Do not reintroduce speculative WAIT result prefetch; it broke result-boundary
  and fatal/COPY semantics.
* Do not optimise only WAIT request count; the ``10 ms`` drain already removed
  most avoidable crossings.
* Do not use parent-only RSS for process comparisons.
* Do not default native worker receive; controlled benefit was neutral.
* Do not default native worker socket wait; it was slower.
* Do not return to Windows AF_UNIX without new evidence.
* Do not reintroduce unsafe one-read TCP framing without preserving over-read.
* Do not resume protocol-5 out-of-band pickle experiments; they were slower.
* Do not spend another iteration on generic serialization/snapshot micro-tuning
  unless fresh profiling shows it dominates.
* Do not optimise bulk decoding while the canonical benchmark keeps it near
  upstream.
* Do not infer GUI responsiveness from worker topology; synchronous calls block
  the invoking thread in every architecture.

Immediate next work
-------------------

#. ``optimized01`` remains **RETAIN**. The rejected timed-vs-untimed
   response queue wait and earlier native-wait, speculative
   prefetch and serialization experiments remain rejected.
#. The Coordinator-authorised **real qt-thread GET status diagnostic
   is COMPLETE**, with archive
   ``qt-thread-real-get-profile-20261103-213627-044.zip``,
   captured at ``1c11f6525bfc75e3db27aeeae65c0498a56df4cd``.
   Four independent repeats x 12 five-block cycles, 1200
   GETs/block. All 48 cycles, 240 blocks and 12 required phase
   counts passed; 115,200 profiled and 172,800 clean-control GETs.
#. The clean GET block wall medians were 29.878-30.999 us/call.
   Instrumented-minus-clean paired wall medians were
   +18.082..+18.740 us/call, positive in 96/96 profiled blocks.
   This **instrumented-versus-clean difference** is confounded
   by the probe and separate connections, not a production saving.
#. Nested instrumented phase wall medians: caller
   ``request`` 50.906 us, ``_dispatch`` 38.412 us,
   active worker ``_run`` turn 14.137 us,
   worker pool ``_handle`` 6.264 us and base
   ``_handle`` 3.965 us. Never sum these inclusive
   times. Worker per-method CPU clocks were mostly zero
   from Windows quantization; clean repeat 3 drifted +61.18%.
#. **Decision: no actionable runtime target.** No real,
   removable, semantically safe operation was identified.
   Production runtime and benchmark v3 are unchanged.
   No ``optimized02`` or new acceptance benchmark.
#. **Next owner: existing 00 Coordinator** for
   independent review of this completed negative profiling
   checkpoint and selection of the next bounded direction.
   No further runtime experiments, Scouts, or competing
   Implementation owners until Coordinator decides.

Coordinator review -- enriched echo decision
--------------------------------------------

* **Role and outcome:** existing ``00 Coordinator`` independently
  reviewed the enriched SimpleQueue echo checkpoint on branch
  ``feature/qt-process-pq`` at observed HEAD ``d226f8e6``.
  Decision: **CONTINUE with real-path, diagnostic-only
  attribution**; no new runtime optimisation or Scout.
* **Evidence:** four independent repeats and 64 cycles
  support positive synthetic representation/bookkeeping
  overhead but cannot identify a dominant removable
  qpsycopg function. Repeat-1 bare baseline drifted
  +131.8%; Windows microsecond CPU attribution is
  unreliable. The ZIP remains local-only, identified
  by SHA256 in the optimisation log.
* **Ownership and next action:** ``10 Implementation — current``
  continues as sole runtime owner. No code or
  benchmark-v3 change was approved. Inspect the real
  GET/request/worker/response path using bounded
  instrumented phases and uninstrumented paired
  controls; preserve original liveness semantics.
  Report a falsifiable actual-code hypothesis or
  stop without ``optimized02``. Then update docs
  and return any significant completed checkpoint
  for independent review.
* **Recovery and context:** this Coordinator stage has
  no uncommitted runtime work or local measurement.
  The Implementation rolling snapshot below remains
  historical evidence of its own last handoff.

Rolling recovery snapshot -- current Implementation owner
---------------------------------------------------------

* **Owner / branch:** current ``10 Implementation`` chat is the sole
  runtime implementation owner for ``ARMAGGIDON/qpsycopg``,
  ``feature/qt-process-pq``. The next bounded responsibility
  belongs to existing ``00 Coordinator`` for *independent review*.
  No competing runtime owner is authorised.
* **Base / known commits:** Coordinator approval
  ``0fc10d668ac9166f07ae3a575049da7b4b14ccd1``;
  Windows diagnostic captured at
  ``1c11f6525bfc75e3db27aeeae65c0498a56df4cd``.
  Measured-doc commits ``1064c818`` and ``83b68c8b``.
  Last HEAD observed before this snapshot update was
  ``83b68c8bf2cc67a9551a21d6f3717c03fd59be81``.
  Verify live HEAD when resuming.
* **Completed hypothesis:** real no-SQL GET worker/caller
  phase profiling after synthetic enriched echo plateau.
  The experiment proved phase call counts and recorded
  inclusive wall-time, but **no exclusive safe removable
  operation**. New hypothesis and new runtime experiment
  remain **unselected** pending Coordinator direction.
* **Code and local state:** this stage introduced only
  ``tools/profile_qt_thread_get_real_path.py`` and
  ``tools/profile_qt_thread_get_real_path.ps1`` plus
  documentation. The measured-result update changes
  **docs only**. No production runtime or canonical v3
  files changed. The user's Windows working tree was
  not inspected; do not assert it is clean.
* **Evidence / tests:** archive
  ``test-results\qt-thread-real-get-profile-20261103-213627-044.zip``
  was uploaded to this chat and is **not committed to
  GitHub**. SHA256 and all measured details are saved
  in ``docs/qt-process-optimization-log.rst``. The user
  should preserve the original ZIP. All 48 cycles
  succeeded, phase counts were exact, and 96/96 paired
  profiled blocks showed extra ~18 us wall. The probe
  itself perturbs timing, repeat 3 drifted +61.18%,
  and per-method Windows CPU is quantized. No smoke
  or v3 acceptance benchmark was rerun: no runtime
  candidate was created.
* **Rejections and guardrails:** ``optimized01`` RETAIN;
  raw untimed get REJECT for no speedup and loss of
  fatal-worker detection. Also avoid prior native
  worker wait, speculative WAIT prefetch and generic
  snapshot/serialization/bulk experiments without new
  evidence. Preserve public Psycopg semantics and
  worker exit, errors, close and cancellation.
* **Next reproducible action:** inspect current HEAD
  and all primary qt-process docs, then send the
  completed negative real-GET checkpoint to existing
  ``00 Coordinator``. No pending Windows command;
  **do not rerun this probe or start optimized02**
  until a new direction is independently approved.
* **Context risk: CAUTION.** Long, tool-heavy
  Implementation history; state remains recoverable
  from GitHub. No remaining-token/window estimates
  and no observed HANDOFF NOW symptoms. A future
  serious inconsistency requires a fresh snapshot
  and explicit same-role transfer, with the former
  owner stopping edits before the new owner resumes.

When resuming in a new chat/session
-----------------------------------

#. Read :doc:`qt-process`, this project map,
   :doc:`qt-process-performance`,
   :doc:`qt-process-coordination` and
   :doc:`qt-process-optimization-log`;
   inspect live branch HEAD.
#. The real GET diagnostic has **already finished**,
   with no actionable optimized02 candidate.
   The uploaded ZIP remains local-only evidence.
#. The next owner is **existing 00 Coordinator**
   for independent milestone review. Runtime ownership
   stays with this Implementation role unless explicitly
   transferred due to context risk; never allow
   simultaneous implementation owners.
