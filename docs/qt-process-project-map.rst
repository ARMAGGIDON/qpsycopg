Qt process backend project map
==============================

This file is the implementation/handoff map for qpsycopg's Qt-oriented pq work.
Read :doc:`qt-process` for behaviour, :doc:`qt-process-performance` for measured
history/rejected experiments, :doc:`qt-process-optimization-log` for the current
checkpoint series, and :doc:`qt-process-coordination` for multi-chat ownership.

Repository state
----------------

* repository: ``ARMAGGIDON/qpsycopg``;
* development branch: ``feature/qt-process-pq``;
* active implementation/optimisation path: ``qt-thread``;
* retained process reference: ``PSYCOPG_IMPL=qt-process``;
* thread implementation: ``PSYCOPG_IMPL=qt-thread``;
* canonical local worker for the current paired benchmark: ``QPSYCOPG_WORKER_IMPL=c``;
* upstream comparison revision: ``99356800e90aa0e7b604f652d714ef0f33422b47``;
* canonical optimisation baseline: ``baseline-v3``;
* accepted runtime optimisation: ``optimized01`` lazy qt-thread cancellation setup;
* ``optimized01`` implementation commits: ``4637ff9`` and ``371bda8``;
* ``optimized01`` measured at ``7c781a97`` with the unchanged v3 benchmark,
  semantic smoke OK; retained for improved connection and resource lifecycle;
* next target: measure and isolate qt-thread short-query CPU/latency overhead,
  keeping cancellation/Qt responsiveness as guardrails.

The current branch has moved beyond the old qt-thread connection blocker. The
complete standalone qt-thread smoke passes. Do not restart work from the old
``64f2ee8`` handoff or from the old process short-query micro-optimisation plan.

Current direction
-----------------

The process-backed implementation already contains the major retained measured
optimisations:

* native ``PGresult -> PackedValues`` packing;
* native packed bulk decoding;
* dedicated cancellation control channel;
* ``10 ms`` worker-side WAIT drain;
* deferred send + one-request fast execute;
* compact/marshal fast frames;
* warmed ``QProcess`` reuse between PostgreSQL sessions;
* cached stable connection state where safe;
* Windows TCP loopback fast path;
* raw Windows named-pipe main transport;
* native parent-side named-pipe frame exchange.

Controlled architecture measurements showed that a dedicated worker thread is
substantially closer to upstream/direct Psycopg than the separate process for
short queries while preserving the required Qt/cancellation semantics. The real
``qt-thread`` backend is therefore the active optimisation path. ``qt-process``
remains a measured reference and an explicit alternative with stronger isolation.

The canonical ``baseline-v3`` established representative qt-thread/upstream
ratios of approximately:

==============================  ===========
Metric                          qt-thread
==============================  ===========
warm connect median             1.409x
SELECT 1 median                 1.273x
short-query CPU                 2.000x
context switches / query        3.032x
100k total                      1.027x
8-thread batch median           1.341x
process-tree RSS                1.320x
private memory                  1.377x
Qt timer p95                    0.982x
Qt timer p99                    1.008x
==============================  ===========

Bulk decode and Qt p95/p99 are not current targets. The remaining stable cost is
primarily short-query fixed overhead plus connection/resource overhead.

Architectural invariants
------------------------

Treat changes to these points as architectural changes, not local optimisations.

#. High-level Psycopg semantics remain in the application process:
   ``Connection``, ``Cursor``, transactions, adaptation, row factories,
   SQLSTATE exception mapping and user callbacks.
#. The stateful libpq ``PGconn`` is worker-owned for both Qt backends.
#. A recycled process worker does not imply a recycled PostgreSQL session.
#. ``qt-process`` and ``qt-thread`` are explicit opt-in backends and never
   implicit fallbacks.
#. The worker pq implementation is ordinary ``c``, ``binary`` or ``python``;
   never recursive ``qt-process``/``qt-thread``.
#. Result adaptation remains parent-side. Worker/native helpers may pack raw
   bytes/metadata but must not replace normal Psycopg adaptation semantics.
#. Psycopg's existing connection lock remains authoritative when a connection is
   shared by caller threads.
#. Synchronous Psycopg calls remain synchronous and block the caller.
#. Ordinary PostgreSQL statement errors must not kill a healthy session.
#. Fatal ``ConnStatus.BAD`` handling must terminate/mark a broken session.
#. Parent-process file descriptors must not be passed to worker libpq.
#. Resource comparisons must use the whole process tree for process-backed modes.
#. Performance claims require compatible paired measurements.

Current qt-process architecture
-------------------------------

On Windows the preferred data path is::

    application process
      |
      +-- Connection / Cursor / adaptation
      |
      +-- synthetic PGconn / PGresult facade
      |
      +-- deferred send / compact fast execute
      |
      +-- raw named pipe
      |     +-- native parent frame exchange when available
      |
      +================ process boundary ================+
                                                        |
                                               reusable QProcess worker
                                                        |
                                               psycopg c/binary/python pq
                                                        |
                                                      libpq

Cancellation uses an independent authenticated localhost TCP control channel with
a worker cancel-control thread and reusable ``PGcancelConn``.

The main Windows transport defaults to ``QPSYCOPG_IPC=pipe``. TCP remains a
fallback. Native worker receive and native socket wait remain disabled by default
because controlled tests did not justify them.

Current qt-thread architecture
------------------------------

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/pq_qt_thread.py`` reuses the synthetic pq facade and worker
state machine but replaces process IPC with ``queue.SimpleQueue`` and a dedicated
worker thread::

    Connection / Cursor
        |
    synthetic PGconn / PGresult
        |
    request/response queues
        |
    qpsycopg worker thread
        |
    psycopg c/binary/python pq
        |
      libpq

The complete standalone semantic smoke passes. It covers adaptation, packed
NULL/empty semantics, multiple result sets, COPY boundaries, SQL error survival,
shared connection/per-thread cursors, cancellation, fatal backend termination and
``AsyncConnection``.

The native remote packed decoder is enabled for qt-thread; the earlier bulk
regression was caused by an accidental pure-Python transformer and is no longer a
current result.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_thread_lazy.py`` is the current ``optimized01`` patch.
It defers cancel-control construction until immediately before the first normal
send. ``psycopg/psycopg/__init__.py`` activates that patch only for
``PSYCOPG_IMPL=qt-thread``.

Source map
----------

Backend selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/__init__.py``
    Selects ``qt-process`` and ``qt-thread`` only when explicitly requested.

``psycopg/psycopg/__init__.py``
    Routes both Qt backends through the remote connection classes and activates
    the qt-thread lazy-cancellation patch only for qt-thread.

``psycopg/psycopg/_cmodule.py``
    Keeps the Qt backends on the Python generator layer because the synthetic
    ``PGconn`` is not a local native connection object.

Parent/process facade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/pq_qt_process.py``
    Base remote pq facade, generic transport, proxy ``PGconn``/``PGresult`` and
    query/connection caches.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_lazy.py``
    Process hot-path patch layer: deferred send, compact fast execute,
    process-worker reuse, lazy cancellation, Windows transport selection and
    native parent named-pipe frame exchange.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_pipe.py``
    Windows named-pipe byte-stream adapter with read-ahead preservation.

Protocol/results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_protocol.py``
    Request/response framing, fast frames, result snapshots and ``PackedValues``.

``psycopg_c/psycopg_c/pq/pgresult.pyx``
    Native result value/metadata packers.

``psycopg_c/psycopg_c/_psycopg/qt_bulk.pyx``
    Parent-side packed decoder for supported standard loaders.

``psycopg/psycopg/_transformer.py``
    Preserves normal adaptation semantics while selecting the packed decoder for
    both remote Qt backends where safe.

Worker/cancellation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_worker.py``
    Base worker request handling and libpq send/wait/consume/result state machine.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_worker_pool.py``
    Reusable process worker specialisations, cached connection state, native
    packing capability detection and profiling hooks.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_process_cancel.py``
    Independent authenticated cancellation control channel.

``psycopg/psycopg/connection_qt_process.py``
    Shared sync/async remote connection lifecycle and wait/cancel routing used by
    both Qt backends.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/pq_qt_thread.py``
    Dedicated-thread transport and shared-interpreter worker integration.

``psycopg/psycopg/pq/_qt_thread_lazy.py``
    Current lazy-cancellation lifecycle optimisation for qt-thread.

Validation and benchmark map
----------------------------

``tools/smoke_qt_thread.py``
    Narrow semantic gate for the thread backend.

``tools/validate_qt_thread.ps1``
    Broader direct/thread/process validation retained for structural checks.

``tools/benchmark_qpsycopg.ps1``
    Canonical current paired benchmark runner. It builds isolated upstream/fork
    environments against the same local libpq and runs adjacent upstream pairs
    for ``direct``, ``qt-thread`` and ``qt-process``.

``tools/bench_qt_process.py``
    SQL/connection/concurrency/cancellation/resource workload.

``tools/bench_qt_responsiveness.py``
    Qt p95/p99 responsiveness workload; maximum stall is diagnostic only.

``tools/summarize_qpsycopg_benchmark.py``
    Produces paired ratios, MAD/range, host drift, architecture deltas and process
    inventory.

``tools/profile_qt_thread_short_query.py`` and
``tools/profile_qt_thread_short_query.ps1``
    Diagnostic CPU attribution: upstream/fork direct/qt-thread warm SELECT
    controls; separate process/caller CPU; worker dispatch/wait phase timers;
    synthetic no-SQL status request as a control for handoff cost. The earlier
    Python 3.13 cProfile attribution was rejected after producing negative
    per-function CPU and cross-thread stack contamination. The corrected
    phase-only Windows archive is now analysed and identifies the synchronous
    thread request/response handoff as the largest fixed non-SQL phase.
    Production runtime and canonical paired v3 workload are unchanged.

``tools/bench_qt_thread_echo_baseline.py`` and
``tools/bench_qt_thread_echo_baseline.ps1``
    Diagnostic-only paired comparison of a minimal two-SimpleQueue echo
    against the existing no-SQL qt-thread PGconn status GET path. Uses timed
    response waits in both cases, interleaved blocks, wall/CPU/context-switch
    measurements, a child-process watchdog and a ZIP result archive.
    The Windows comparison is complete: both modes have about two context
    switches/call; qpsycopg has a positive extra ~19 us median paired
    wall delay but strong temporal drift. Neither the residual nor any
    specific allocation is proven removable. Runtime and benchmark v3
    are unchanged.

``tools/bench_qt_thread_enriched_echo.py`` and
``tools/bench_qt_thread_enriched_echo.ps1``
    Coordinator-approved diagnostic-only progressively enriched queue echo:
    bare token, real Request/Response NamedTuple, validation, synthetic worker
    bookkeeping, and real qt-thread no-SQL GET. Independent subprocess runs,
    short balanced blocks, bracketing bare controls and timestamp-based
    linear drift adjustment. Windows measurement is pending. This does
    **not** install runtime changes or modify benchmark v3.

The canonical current baseline is ``baseline-v3``. Older ``initial`` and
``baseline-v2`` checkpoints used different benchmark definitions and must not be
used as the direct before-state for numbered optimisations.

Established decisions / do not repeat blindly
---------------------------------------------

* Do not reintroduce speculative WAIT result prefetch; it broke result-boundary
  and fatal/COPY semantics.
* Do not optimise only WAIT request count; the ``10 ms`` drain already removed
  most avoidable crossings.
* Do not use parent-only RSS for process comparisons.
* Do not default native worker receive; controlled benefit was neutral.
* Do not default native worker socket wait; it was slower.
* Do not return to Windows AF_UNIX without new evidence.
* Do not reintroduce unsafe one-read TCP framing without preserving over-read.
* Do not resume protocol-5 out-of-band pickle experiments; they were slower.
* Do not spend another iteration on generic serialization/snapshot micro-tuning
  unless fresh profiling shows it dominates.
* Do not optimise bulk decoding while the canonical benchmark keeps it near
  upstream.
* Do not infer GUI responsiveness from worker topology; synchronous calls block
  the invoking thread in every architecture.

Immediate next work
-------------------

#. ``optimized01`` remains **RETAIN**. The previous timed-vs-untimed
   response queue wait A/B is **REJECT** (no meaningful speedup,
   fatal worker liveness regression). Do not repeat it.
#. The minimal token echo vs qpsycopg GET diagnostic at
   ``492ab431`` completed with +18.957 us paired wall
   GET-minus-echo median, 8/8 positive pairs and strong temporal
   drift. It did **not** prove the residual removable.
#. Independent ``00 Coordinator`` review of that checkpoint returned
   **CONTINUE** for *diagnostic-only* progressively enriched echo.
   The new tools ``tools/bench_qt_thread_enriched_echo.py`` and
   ``tools/bench_qt_thread_enriched_echo.ps1`` are staged.
#. The diagnostic compares five levels in one worker topology:
   bare token, Request/Response, validation, synthetic worker
   bookkeeping, and real warmed no-SQL qpsycopg GET status.
   It uses the same timed queue waiting throughout. The richer
   stages are **synthetic approximations**, not automatically
   removable implementation components.
#. Control temporal drift with four **independent child processes**
   by default, 16 short six-block cycles/repeat, and
   bare-echo bracketing controls on both sides of each balanced,
   rotated/reversed set of four modes. There are 600 calls/block,
   250 warmups/mode and timestamp-based linear interpolation
   between controls. Capture wall, process/caller/other CPU,
   context switches, per-cycle median/MAD and between-repeat
   differences. Flag nonstationarity; don't treat a noisy
   ~19 us earlier residual as a speedup target.
#. **Next user action:** run
   ``.\tools\bench_qt_thread_enriched_echo.ps1`` on the Windows
   checkout and send ``qt-thread-enriched-echo-*.zip`` to the
   **current Implementation chat**. No performance conclusion
   or runtime candidate is authorised by merely staging this tool.
#. Implementation owner must analyse the full archive, decide
   whether one stage cost is measured and falsifiable, and
   update the performance/optimization log. Do **not** begin
   ``optimized02`` or change production runtime/v3 without
   verified evidence and a safe plan.
#. After a significant completed investigation decision and
   GitHub documentation update, send the result to existing
   ``00 Coordinator`` for mandatory independent review. No
   Scout/other Implementation chat is needed while this
   diagnostic is pending.

When resuming in a new chat/session
-----------------------------------

#. Read :doc:`qt-process`, this project map,
   :doc:`qt-process-performance` and
   :doc:`qt-process-coordination`, inspect GitHub HEAD
   and :doc:`qt-process-optimization-log`.
#. ``optimized01`` remains retained. Timed-vs-untimed
   queue wait, native worker wait, speculative WAIT prefetch
   and generic snapshot/serialization experiments remain
   rejected absent new evidence.
#. The next bounded diagnostic is enriched echo, **staged
   but not yet measured on Windows**. The current
   Implementation chat should receive the new archive.
#. Do not route a pending measurement to Coordinator,
   start ``optimized02``, or create a Scout prematurely.
